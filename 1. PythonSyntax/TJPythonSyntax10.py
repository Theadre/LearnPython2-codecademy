quotient = 6/2
# the value of quotient is now 3, which makes sense

quotient = 7/2
# the value of quotient is 3, even though the result of the division here is 3.5

quotient1 = 7./2
# the value of quotient1 is 3.5
quotient2 = 7/2.
# the value of quotient2 is 3.5
quotient3 = 7./2.
# the value of quotient3 is 3.5

quotient1 = float(7)/2
# the value of quotient1 is 3.5
